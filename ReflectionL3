When you are working with another person, or you need a "free" save

Causes lag

Branch: creating experiments
Clones: what to make something different
Fork: Make something different from another person

Being able to compare them

Emailing, working on the same computer, git alot easier

Working with others, dangerous expermient mwahhaha
